Cells are the boxes you see in the grid of an Excel worksheet, like this one. Each cell is identified on a worksheet by its reference,
 the column letter and row number that intersect at the cell's location. This cell is in column D and row 5, so it is cell D5. 
 The column always comes first in a cell reference.
 
 2.How can you restrict someone from copying a cell from your worksheet?
 On the Review tab, click Protect Sheet. In the Allow all users of this worksheet to list, select the elements you want people to be able to change.
 Move the pointer to cells for which the Locked box is checked on the Protection tab of the Format Cells dialog box. 
 By default, users are allowed to select locked cells.
 
 3.How to move or copy the worksheet into another workbook?
 Click the sheet that you want to copy to the other workbook. On the Edit menu, click Sheet > Move or Copy Sheet.
 On the To book menu, click the workbook that you want to move the sheet to. 
 
 4. Which key is used as a shortcut for opening a new window document?

 5.What are the things that we can notice after opening the Excel interface?
 The interface components of Excel include the Quick Access Toolbar, Ribbon, Name Box, Formula Quick Menu, Formula Bar, Status Bar,

6. When to use a relative cell reference in excel?
By default, a cell reference is a relative reference, which means that the reference is relative to the location of the cell. 
If, for example, you refer to cell A2 from cell C2, you are actually referring to a cell that is two columns to the left (C minus A)â€”in the same row (2).
